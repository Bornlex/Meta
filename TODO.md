# TODO

## Crucial points
- [ ] Train the prediction on actual weights update
- [ ] Compute the number of flops required for training
- [ ] Generate synthetic dataset using a finite-state machine + some noise

## Further directions

- [ ] Reinforcement learning
- [ ] Best order in which to see the examples (network could predict order)
- [ ] Can we integrate over our meta network to get the fixed point?
